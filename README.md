Chatter
=======

Yet another simple chat application.

Doing this as an exercise to try and put together a few things and learn how to
use them (together).

 - spring-boot 'microservices'
 - spring-cloud-stream
 - rabbitmq message broker service (installed locally via docker, or remotely as a CF service)
 - simple javascript single-page app for the UI.
 - webjars to provide some of the js dependencies (e.g. jquery, sockjs)
